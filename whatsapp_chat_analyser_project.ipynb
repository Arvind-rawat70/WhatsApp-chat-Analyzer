Please read the following carefully and ensure you follow these guidelines to improve your email communication.\n","\n","Sending emails without subject line.\n","Typing complete email in Subject Line.\n","Sending emails without Signature.\n","Replying on emails by using reply to all option instead of reply option.\n","\n","These are some of the examples. So to overcome these errors we all need to work on this. Sharing some of the important tips that you can share with the students.\n","\n","Professional Email Etiquette for Students\n","Here are important tips you need to know when writing an email in your professional environment.\n"," \n","Include a clear, direct subject line. People often decide whether to open an email based on the subject line. Good subject lines give the reader a preview of what the email is about.\n","Begin each email with a greeting: Always greet “Dear Sir/Ma’am” is good etiquette. Otherwise, if you launch into your email without a greeting or introduction you run the risk of seeming impolite or impatient.\n","End emails in a friendly way: Use ending such as “Regards” or “Have a great day”. Even if you use the same ending with everyone, it ends the email in a warm and positive way.\n","Think twice before hitting Reply All. No one wants to read emails from 20 people that have nothing to do with them. Refrain from hitting Reply All unless you really think everyone on the list needs to receive the email.\n","Include a signature block. Provide your reader with some information about you, such as your full name, title, course name, campus name, year of passing and your contact information, including a phone number. Use the same font, type size, and color as the rest of the email.\n","Be cautious with humour. Humour can easily get lost in translation without the right tone or facial expressions. In a professional exchange, it is better to leave humour out of emails unless you know the recipient well.\n","Proofread every message. Ensure you are using correct spelling and proper grammar. Your mistakes will be noticed by the recipients and you may be judged for making them. Do not rely on spell-checkers. Read and reread your email, preferably aloud, before sending it.\n","\n","Keep your fonts classic. The ideal font is Arial, size 12 in black. Your emails should be easy for other people to read.\n","\n","Nothing is confidential--so write accordingly. A basic guideline is to assume that others will see what you write. Don't write anything that would be ruinous to you or hurtful to others.\n","\n","Use threads: if you get a message from someone and you are going to respond, don’t send a new message, simply hit the reply option (Avoid using Reply-All Option) on your email, this keeps the original subject line with “Re:” in front of it.\n","\n","Be concise: Get to the point of your email as quickly as possible, but don’t leave out important details that will help your recipient answer your query.\n","\n","Do not use all CAPS in your emails: This is perceived as yelling in the digital world. If you need to emphasize something, use bold or italics on the points you want to emphasize.\n","\n","If you are sending an email with an attachment, make mention of it in the body of the email: Write in the email that you are sending an attachment so that the reader knows there is more to the email than just the text.\n","8/28/24, 2:07 PM - +91 99104 40018: 3B is required to be ready with 4 sheets name and Roll No written for Test scheduled.\n","8/28/24, 2:30 PM - +91 99104 40018: CR12.. 3B...reach immediately\n","8/28/24, 4:54 PM - +91 99104 40018: This message was deleted\n","8/28/24, 4:56 PM - +91 99104 40018: All students of *Sec VC* note that now onwards\n","*Thursday (11:55-12:50) and Friday (9:00-9:55) CBNST lectures* will be conducted in *CR13*.\n","8/28/24, 5:01 PM - +91 99104 40018: It's for V SEM KINDLY IGNORE\n","8/29/24, 9:30 AM - Kashish Mirza: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ernj4aS-ZVEgWJ6CUDua2Q3rfPlSggmABRIaY6LYzyA/edit?usp=sharing\n","8/29/24, 9:30 AM - Kashish Mirza: Dear students, \n","Kindly write the reason for not clearing your dues yet. \n","Do it before 11:00 am today.\n","8/29/24, 9:31 AM - Kashish Mirza: <Media omitted>\n","8/29/24, 9:31 AM - Kashish Mirza: After 11:00 am, form will be closed. \n","It’s compulsory.\n","8/29/24, 9:42 AM - +91 89797 84117: <Media omitted>\n","8/29/24, 9:42 AM - +91 89797 84117: <Media omitted>\n","8/29/24, 9:44 AM - +91 89797 84117: Section B (G3/G4)\n","\n","Today's lab work👆\n","8/29/24, 10:15 AM - +91 94584 92406: AI and DS students, Come to my cabin at 10:50.
